    <h1>Rules of Photography</h1>

    <p>
        If your shot is in danger of losing impact due to a busy background/surroundings, 
        crop in tight around your main point of focus, eliminating the background so all attention falls on your main subject. 
        This works particularly well with portraits when you're trying to capture something more intimate and focused or
        are shooting in a busy location where what's around them would just cause a distraction. Filling the frame could
        involve you capturing them from the waist up or for more impact, fill the frame with just their face. 
        Patterns are another subject that when capturing,you should fill the frame with, aligning it up 
        carefully to ensure it's straight.
        The most basic of all photography rules, the rule of thirds, is all about dividing your shot into nine equal sections
        by a set of vertical and horizontal lines. With the imaginary frame in place, you should place the 
        most important element(s) in your shot on one of the lines or where the lines meet. It's a technique 
        that works well for landscapes as you can position the horizon on one of the horizontal lines 
        that sit in the lower and upper part of the photograph while you're vertical subjects (trees etc.) 
        can be placed on one of the two vertical lines.
